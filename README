== Getting Started
Install Minishift: https://github.com/minishift/minishift
(Probably also works fine with other OpenShift clusters, but this is not tested)

Run setup.sh to set up a Listener pod in your Minishift cluster, then run
run.sh to run the JMXClient image beside that. From within the JMXClient shell
that run.sh drops you into, type "connect jmx-listener:9091" to connect your
client to the JVM running in the target pod. For more insight on what to do
after that, see these related repositories:
