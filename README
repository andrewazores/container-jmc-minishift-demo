== Getting Started
Install Minishift: https://github.com/minishift/minishift
(Probably also works fine with other OpenShift clusters, but this is not tested)

Ensure your local Minishift cluster is running (`minishift start`) before
continuing. Use `oc login` so that your Openshift client is correctly connected
to your Minishift cluster.

Run setup.sh to set up a Listener pod in your Minishift cluster, then run
run.sh to run the JMXClient image beside that. From within the JMXClient shell
that run.sh drops you into, type "connect jmx-listener:9091" to connect your
client to the JVM running in the target pod. For more insight on what to do
after that, see these related repositories:

Once you have dumped recording(s) to download from the target JVM, use
`oc status` to view the exposed route for the svc/jmx-client service, which
will provide you a URL pointing to the client image's recording download path
(including the correct port). You can then download your recordings by
appending the name of the recording to this URL.

For example, if "connect jmx-listener:9091; list" in your JMXClient shell
lists a recording named "foo", and `oc status` gives you a route URL of
http://jmx-client-myproject.10.0.0.1.nip.io , then you can download your
recording with ex.
`wget http://jmx-client-myproject.10.0.0.1.nip.io/foo -O foo.jfr`, or for
convenience, `sh download.sh foo`, which is equivalent to the wget above.
